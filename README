Our code has already been compiled and tested in Ubuntu (64-bit).
- How to Run? 
Change to the source file directory, in the command line, input the following:(order as mentioned in the instruction)
java RunExperiments <filename> <algorithm> <cutoff time in seconds> <random seed>
e.g., java RunExperiments karate.graph LS1 600 11
The input graph file should be in the same directory as the source code, and the output file wil be generated in the same directory as well.

- Structure 
<RunExperiments> - for running the program.
<Algorithm> - for branch and bound algorithm
<Approx> - for approximation algorithm
<finishTask> - for terminating branch and bound
<Graph> - graph data structure used in branch and bound
<HillClimbing> - local search algorithm with hill climbing
<LS2> - local search algorithm with simulated annealing
<Vertex> - vertex data structure used in branch and bound
